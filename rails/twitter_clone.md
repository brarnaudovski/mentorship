# *TwitterClone* web application

This build introduces a well known social media giant Twitter into the mix as inspiration for the task. We will be creating a knock-off of sorts called *TwitterClone*.

**Before start**, please consider this:
 - Build at your own tempo. No need to rush. No deadline to make.
 - Follow the solution in the *Blog* application if you need help/direction.
 - Try not to copy-paste from other solutions.
 - Note every *how?* and *why?*, and report to me or in the group.

### Building Tweets

First feature we want to build is a basic CRUD action where we can create, read, update, and destroy *Tweets*.

Short direction:
 - Create new app using the `rails new` command.
 - Consider to use `git` to track the files/changes. In addition of `git`, create new repo in Github and attach this project to Github.
 - Create the controller and the views for the *Twitter* resource. If you know upfront what action you'll need in the controller, you may use the `rails generate controller` command to scaffold the controller and the views.
