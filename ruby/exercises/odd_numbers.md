# Odd number

Given an array of `n` numbers, you need to write two methods. First method is to find the first integer which appears an odd number of times, and the second methods is to return all of the integers which appears an odd number of times:

Example:
```ruby
input_array = [1, 1, 2, -2, 5, 2, 4, 4, -1, -2, 5, 5]

# First integer would be: 5
# All the integers would be: [5, -1]
```

```ruby
input_array = [10]

# First integer would be: 10
# All the integers would be: [10]
```
